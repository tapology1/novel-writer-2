## Roadmap for Novel Polishing and Cover Generation

### 1. Create `refine.py` Script
   - [ ] **Objective**: This script will process each chapter through a high-end LLM for refinement.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Set up a loop to read chapters from the CSV file one by one.
     - [ ] Integrate the LLM API to send chapter content for refinement.
     - [ ] Handle responses and save the refined content.

### 2. Dynamic Prompt Editing System
   - [ ] **Objective**: Allow easy editing of prompts used for the LLM.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Create a `config` folder with a `prompts` subfolder.
     - [ ] Store prompts in `.txt` files within the `prompts` folder.
     - [ ] Implement command-line functionality to select a prompt file.
     - [ ] Pass the selected prompt along with the chapter content to the LLM.

### 3. Book Cover Generation
   - [ ] **Objective**: Generate a book cover using the Robolly API.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Research and integrate the Robolly API for image generation.
     - [ ] Create a function to handle cover generation requests.
     - [ ] Save the generated cover image to a specified location.

### 4. Output to DOCX
   - [ ] **Objective**: Format the final output into a DOCX file using a template.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Locate the DOCX template in `config/docx_template`.
     - [ ] Use a library like `python-docx` to manipulate the DOCX file.
     - [ ] Control heading styles and formatting based on the template.
     - [ ] Save the final document with a specified filename.

### 5. Testing and Validation
   - [ ] **Objective**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Test the `refine.py` script with sample chapters.
     - [ ] Validate the dynamic prompt selection and ensure it works as expected.
     - [ ] Test the cover generation and DOCX output functionalities.
     - [ ] Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### 6. Documentation
   - [ ] **Objective**: Provide clear instructions for using the system.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Write a README file explaining how to set up and run the project.
     - [ ] Document the structure of the `config` folder and how to edit prompts.
     - [ ] Include examples of how to use the `refine.py` script.
